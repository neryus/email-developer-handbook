## Code editors
Code editors for the development of HTML emails:

### Adobe Dreamweaver
At work, I'm using Dreamweaver and find it very good for editing, and troubleshooting email templates. Mostly because of the design view and select tool.

Tools:
- Find and Replace (current document, open documents, folder)
- Select the tool in the design view
- Collapse full tag
- Quick tag editor (to quickly wrap text in tags select it, press Ctrl+T to open the tag editor, and start typing to move quickly to the tags you want to wrap the text in, using the up-down arrow keys if needed).
- Apply/Remove comment
- W3C Validation
- Preview in browser
- Code hints
- Code snippets.
  Importing custom snippets to Dreamweaver is a bit [complicated stuff](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1005503). First, you need to create a custom snippet, you will be able to locate a snippets folder where you can paste in the custom snippets. The CS6 folder is here: C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Dreamweaver CS6\en_US\Configuration\Snippets"
  To export custom snippets from Dreamweaver head to (C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Dreamweaver 2021\en_GB\Configuration\Snippets) and copy snippets from there.
- Default keyboard shortcut for break line element
- `Ctrl+D` keys to duplicate selected content or the last line where the cursor is.
- Multiple cursor

Plugins:
- [Emmet](https://github.com/emmetio/dreamweaver), after some headache to install and set up it on Dreamweaver this tool saves a lot of repeating typing.

### Atom

My extensions:
- [eddy-malou-lorem-ipsum](https://atom.io/packages/eddy-malou-lorem-ipsum)
- [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/eddy-malou-lorem-ipsum)
- [spacegray-atom-dark-syntax](https://atom.io/themes/spacegray-atom-dark-syntax)
- [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)
- [html-nested-comments](https://atom.io/packages/html-nested-comments)
- [Palladium](https://atom.io/packages/palladium) - didn't tried yet. But it's sounds promising to be able to send test emails straight from Atom.

### Brackets

I find Brackets very usefull for creating email templates from scratch.

Tools:
- Find function (Alt+F3), it selects all match strings and you can them all in one, just start typing new string.
- Multi selection is awesome for emails.

My extensions:
- [Brackets Editor Bookmarks](https://github.com/JeffryBooher/brackets-bookmarks-extension)
- [Brackets Icons](https://github.com/ivogabe/Brackets-Icons)

### HTMLPad

### Litmus Builder

### Notepad++

### Sublime Text

## CSS Inliners

Some email clients strip out or just ignore &lt;head&gt; and &lt;style&gt; tags from emails, so it's best to have your CSS written inline within your markup.

### [Premailer](http://premailer.dialect.ca/)

### [Mailchimp](https://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/)

Very basic tool, do what it says. Just paste your CSS and HTML and you will get inlined styles to your markup. It keeps classes in markup, not delete them.

### [Campaign Monitor](https://inliner.cm/)

## Browser Extensions

### Chrome

#### [Responsive Web Design Tester](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mobileresponsive-web-desi/elmekokodcohlommfikpmojheggnbelo)

The name says everything. I like this extension because it allows to test the HTML document on various devices and agents and it works as separate browser window.

## Image Compressors

### [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/), TinyJPG

At the moment it's the best tool to compress image size. Easy to use web service for up to 20 images without signing up.
What I like:
- Compresses png and jpg formats.
- Simple web interface.
- The history of last compressed files.
- Bulk upload of up to 20 images.
- Better quality compression on some examples compares with Compressor.io tool.

### [Kraken.io](https://kraken.io/web-interface) Web

Has a free option with web interface, which is good if you using this tools from time to time or just couple times a day. But I found that not every jpg or png image would be optimized.

### [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/online)

This service don't has web interface and only the Mac users can use it as application. It also has web API service. Can't say more, because didn't had a chance to try.

### [Compressor](https://compressor.io/)

A free online tool to compress images without losing the original quality. Supports 4 formats - jpeg, png, gif and svg. Tried only png, cannot say anything about other formats.

It offers two types of compression - lossless or lossy, but don't explain what's the difference between them.

One awesome thing is adding 'compressor' to a file names.

### [Jpegmini](http://www.jpegmini.com/)

Only for jpeg format. But has an extensive tool collection, from the web service to desktop (Mac & PC). The web service compresses one picture at the time.

## Image editors

### [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
After creating first email designs I found it quite interesting tool. Will update this later after email designs need to be converted to HTML documents.

### [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)
The free image editor is web-based and comes with a UI that is very similar to what you’re used from Photoshop. Photopea supports layers, layer masks and blend modes, and offers a lot of the tools that you love from Photoshop: the Magic Wand, Lasso, and Clone Tool, for example. It can handle PSD, Gimp, and WebP files, as well as common image formats, of course. A nice alternative for quick edits.

## [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/)

A web-based image editor to crop or resize an image very quickly. Only a few tools available for free. Supports jpg and png formats.

## [LunaPic](http://www169.lunapic.com/editor/)

Free web-based image editor. It has all the basic tools for image editing. Supports gif, jpg, png, psd formats. Have an option to create gif format files from video. Should be a great alternative to Photoshop.
Didn't tested in the field.

## GIF
### Animated GIF maker [imgflip](https://imgflip.com/gifgenerator)
Make animated GIFs from video files, Youtube, or video websites.
### Animated GIF editor and GIF maker [EZGIF](https://ezgif.com/)
Ezgif.com is a simple online GIF maker and toolset for basic animated GIF editing. Here you can create, resize, crop, reverse, optimize, and apply some effects to GIFs.

### [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)
This desktop capture tool allows to output image as a gif. Available for Windows and OSX users. Good tool to capture videos or providing instructions.
